Purpose :

Chapters :
	- Intro
		- People won't go out to say "wow, what an organized and well managed show." They say "wow, what a great show" or "what great dancing" "choreo" "set design" "music." Ultimately, to the audience, you won't exist, you won't matter. and that's exactly the point. you are not there for praise or applause. that's for the dancers, the choreographers, the coaches. 

		- so who are you doing it for. you are doing it for the dancers, the choreographers, the coaches. you're putting on a great show for them. so they don't have anything to worry about but dance. they put all their troubles and doubts on you and you take them all gladly. that's why they're in sparkles and you're in black. they in the spot light and you in the shadows. and giving them the best show they've ever been a part of, is the best thing you can do for them.

		- as for the audience. you'll know you've done a good job if they never see you or see your mistakes or any evidence of "backstage" It should appear as if this show happened by magic. Something they can't explain. The magic is in the mystery.

		You are a mystery, a very organized, efficient & punctual mystery

	- Stage Manager Basics
		- Responsibilities 
			- Head the Stage Manager Team
			- Ensure smooth transition from rehearsals to stage
			- Assist Ate Gelu & Sir Von
			- Coordinate with Theatre Personnel
			- Be awesome

		- Basic skills
			- Organized 
				- You will work with at least 100 people and you will be in the center of them all-girl. Any question asked of you, you will have to know the answer, and unless you have an iedetic memory you better have good documents.

			 	- There's a lot to be done in a short amount of time, with limited manpower, resources and money. 

			- Punctuality 
				- Filipino time is for audience members. If you are not on time to the second, the show will start 2 hours late. You initate everything. It all starts with you, everything will snowball for every delay you cause.

			- Efficient
				- don't just work hard, work smart. you have acads too
				A dumb person would write several copies of a document
				a smart person would have it photocopied
				Be a smart person
			- Calm
				- if things go wrong, set falls, music stops, dancer injury. it is up to you to be the strong one. tendency is, everyone will freak. You don't.
			- Focused
				- stay focused during dances. it's tempting to cheer for your friends, but you have to stay focused cause you might miss cues or a mishap
			- Flexible
				things change last minute, it's something you have to deal with. it's not up to you to contest it. it's up to you to make it work.

		Don't be...
			Hardworking
				- you're time is too valueable for painting sets or transcripting host spiels. Delagate. Find a more efficient way.

			Nice
				- you're stage manager. you need to command a presence. If you need make a major call you need people to listen to you. You can be bipolar and be nice after.

			Eloquent
				- Time is money. People have lots to do. Get to the point.   
		- Repertoire making
			the repertoire is the most important thing you have. It is your identity. Your whole being. Guard it with your life!
			repertoire reproduce at the last minute. there will be changes til the very end. keep note of all copies made during rehearsals and collect them all after. all repertoires should be consistent. hell will break loose if not.
			always put date, version number and your name (so if something is wrong, people know who's fault it is)
			people with copies of repertoire rehearsal
				1. sm (you)
				2. asm (only 1 of them)
				3. tech
				4. sir von 
			people with copies of repertoire showday
				1. sm left
				2. sm right
				3. asm left
				4. asm right

		- Stage Manager Team

			Your SM team is the most important set of people in your life (during this season). Know all their names, get to know them better every opportunity you get, because the entire show relies on how much you trust your people. When something happens and things need to change quickly, there's no time to second guess their judgement or capability. Mentor them well, show your faith in them, and they will not fail you. Besides, their membership would be on the line, so I'm pretty sure they'll do their best. 

			Before show day, you will act as Head stage manager with 2 applicants as your assistants. On showday, Ate Gelu will come and take on head, and you will be in charge of relaying everything for a smooth transition. Everything MUST be ready by the time Ate Gelu comes. 

			Stage Manager Left (Head) 
				- Head Stage Manager is normally on Stage Right cause that's the wing that leads to the main dressing room. But strangely, UP Theater is the only theatre where it's in the opposite Side
				- Handles most entrances and gives cues, music, lights, curtains, voice overs etc.
			Stage Manager Right
				- Handles right side entrances
				- Since props are usually places in the large area on the right side, SM right handles most props entrances and exits
			Assistant Stage Manager Left
				- Calls dancers and propsmen to standby
			Assistant Stage Manager Right
				- Calls dancers and propsmen to standby

	- People (Working with... )
		- Dancers
			Dancers and especially high school dancers have short attention spans. As my lola (a fomer dean of up) says, keep your speech at 2 mins max, after people fall asleep. My lola is a very sharp lady.
		- Manpower (UP Street)
			apps- memorize everyone's names if possible
		- Manpower (Theater personel)
			get to know all the head's names at least
		- Tech crew
		- Choreographers
		- Artistic director
			take notes for artistic director
			make notes legible and understandable
			stay beside when director is giving comments
		- UP Street officers / Production crew
		- Production Manager
		- Ate Gelu / Head stage manager
		- SM Team
			hug your sm team after and congratulate them

	- Milestones
		- Upon finding who got the role
		- Week before show
			know all the dances and who their choreographers are
			know all the videos and music and who's making each one (if not yet finished)
			preset or entering
			tech rehearsals
				simulate everything to it's actuality as much as possible. it should be the tech apps there. the very equipment, the very cables. 
		- Day before show
			in everything til day before the show, allow the choreographers the time they need to make their dances perfect. it's street fuzion, people are always cramming. But come show day, it's your time. 
		- Day of show
			if a choreographer takes the time to describe the lights, make sure it gets done. i wasn't able to get the light of coach yang right for the creation piece. we didn't have to time to rehearse it, but i probably could have found another way or made sure there was time to put in the lights. the timing was off and the effect of "there was light" didn't happen.

			walkie talkies are the best
			have at least 3
			1. front of house
			2. audience area
			3. backstage
			efficiency increased tremndoulsy especially if signal is low
			don't forget to wait a few seconds before speaking
			don't lose the antenna, they are expensive.
		- Before show
			
			company call 30 minutes before open house. don't include front of house people. include everyone else, apps, guests, etc.

		- Showtime
			- punctuality isn't trying to be faster a few hours before curtain up. you have to be on time the whole day of. you have to be on time in the days leading to. 3 days before, get sir von (or artistic director) to schedule out all 3 days and showday already, which dances need to be blocked, polishings, dress rehearsal everything. then follow it the best you can as early as possible
			- Personal setup
			- Stations final check

			

			keep the headset mic up or super cover it when talking/shouting to dancers backstage.it gets loud and will disturb the tech people on the other end 

			asm are also there to run to the hosts, hand over mics. or pick up props that fell between dances.
				how to pick up a fallen item
				1. plan your route to the item
				2. strategize how to pick it up (i'm serious, it gets dark, pitch black. i ran to get a prop, but i could not see it, i just ran back)
				3. wait for blackout or sm cue
				4. run like the wind to the item
				5. pick up item
				6. run straight across if possible to the other side.

	- Rules
		utlimate pet peeve - dancers peeking in the wings. it's hard to resist, but once an audience member sees someone peeking the show loses it's professionalism immensely. tell the dancers to leave earlier if they can't get there faster.

		don't implement rules you don't follow yourself. if people can't go past a certain point at the wings, you shouldn't either. 

		if dancers have to quick change onstage, make them do so with character

		it's always music then lights

	- General tips
		- dress well - you feel more confident. On a more practical side, looking and dressing well will make it easy for others to work with you because you look trustworthy.
		- You have power. Use it.

		- I'm not Ate Gelu but i knew what I was doing
 		- Don't make your reminders too long. i learned that the hard way.
 		- don't wait til last minute. if you think you need help, admit it and look for help.
 		- be punctual, don't start 1 hour late. but useless if there's no one watching.
 		always have a printer backstage
	
	- Concert Stories
		groove central 6
			 - the show was in meralco theater, far, we left some important props. It was very traffic. The backdrop came 2 hours before show time. Theater personnel, understandly takes their break during this time. but they had to overtime for our mistake. 
			 - don't forget to print the repertoire in LANDSCAPE, not portait. especially if it's edited in landscape
			 -stage looked empty during battles, made dancers go onstage. implmentation was awkward
			 - apps weren't enough, lots crammed, dancers had to step in and help
		street fuzion 11 reconnect
			the set design was a monitor and mouse. The mouse was huge with wooden structure and everything. It obviously took the apps a lot of effort to make. It was all black though and couldn't be placed nicely on stage and just looked like a black lump. It was taken out of the show.

			the light cord for the set wasn't placed very strategically. After compet piece, someone must have tripped over a cord and the stage left light fixture went out. It stayed off for the remainer of the show.
		groove central 2011
			host script was difficult to understand so classes weren't said in sequence. but thankfully only in last part. it was crammed backstage so difficult to deviate.
			parens were very difficult. late start. people getting angry outside. it also started to rain. if it does, let people in immediately. move the line start in. 
		chosen ground 7
			materials were incomplete. the certs for 2nd and 3rd place weren't there. sir von awkwardly just shook their hands.
			host script was all made last minute all the bits were in different sized paper

			up film had only 1 entrance in and out. it was very difficult.
			street fuzion 12 word

			in all-girl compet piece (with full skirts) the music stopped in the first fourth. player was low batt and died. needed blackout, house music on, and reset the piece.
			since the songs were connected, we couldn't pause the music to wait for compet to be complete on stage for their contemp piece. had to stop music. it took a while to get the music back to the same place.
			this could have been prevented. i had it in my notes to remind compet of this fast entrance. but in annoucements, i just said a general, everyone should come earlier. so the note wasn't taken properly.

			during stage rehearsal on showday, practice the sound effects dance. a set of girls danced barefoot. Ate jam stepped on a push pin upon entering and yes it hurt. The 2D jeepney set from the earlier first day funk dance had the push pin this fell off from. We're supposed to prevent dancer injury not cause them. This should never happen again
		chosen ground 8
			no switcher, no access to projecter. pau and abbey had to climb up on a scaffold and physically cover and uncover the projector inbetween dances. with only tech cueing through a walking talkie. it was very difficult.
			judges table wasn't ready when judges were announced DURING THE SHOW. everyone forgot about it.
			one groups music stopped 2/3rd of the way, they had to repeat. another group's mix was strange, some parts too loud some parts too soft. sound guy had to keep on the volume too decrease if it got too loud or increase if it got too soft.

			it was in a parking lot, stage got sandy. had to call a janitor to mop the stage twice during the show.
			street fuzion 13 puso
			set up. 
			- the heartbeat line couldn't appear on either side of the screen so it was just connected and placed on top
			- the heartbeat line was supposed to glow when black light was on. but the paint used was flat and didn't shine. This was an hour before the show. We had to call all the app and DANCERS even to help out in wrapping each and every wooden panel with sratch bond paper, which would work fine in the end.
			sir xernan indak piece. an autoalert came out in the laptop used, and the music stopped 1 min before the end. the punchline was ruined
			had to repeat dance. but we had to redo the set change from act 3 to act 4
			act 4, we took too long, we were scene on stage. and a cloth panel fell slightly because it wasnt installed properly
			in intermission mtv piece. the plastic cup of water used for the one direction segment was left on stage. it didn't cause damage but it could have
			groove central broadway
			poles to too long to be removed for second show. it took 40 seconds. curtains went up the feet of the airforce boys 
			didn't have an assistant manager (they kept leaving the station) so classes weren't called for the final bow in the first show. and not everyone was their when coach vimi called the class.
